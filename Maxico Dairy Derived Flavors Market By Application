Confectionery</h2> <p>The confectionery industry is another key area in which dairy-derived flavors play a significant role. Dairy flavors are extensively used in a variety of confectionery products, such as chocolates, candies, gummies, and sweets. In Mexico, the consumption of confectionery items is rising, particularly among the younger demographic. Dairy flavors such as milk, cream, and butter are commonly used to enhance the richness and creaminess of these products.
